# scifi

Source code modules of the `scifi` package, located in the `src` folder, serve as the backbone of your data engineering and data science projects. These modules encapsulate reusable pieces of code, such as functions, classes, and configurations, that can be leveraged across multiple notebooks and jobs. By organizing code into modules, teams can maintain clean, modular, and efficient codebases, making it easier to manage and scale projects over time. These modules typically reside in a repository and are imported into notebooks or jobs as needed, ensuring consistency and reducing code duplication across different tasks and workflows.
